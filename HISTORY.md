# 2021-10

# 2021-12
Presented to [plenary meeting for Stage 2 on 2021-12-14][2021-12-14].
Was rejected due to need to clarify `await`ing semantics
with and without mapping-function arguments.

# 2022-07
Discussion occurred about `await`ing semantics and mapping functions in [issue
#19][]. It was eventually decided to match `for await` and the proposed
[AsyncIterator.prototype.toArray][iterator-helpers] by `await`ing values from
input sync iterators once, `await`ing values from input async iterators not at
all, and `await`ing results returned by mapping functions once.

# 2022-09
The [plenary advances this proposal to StageÂ 3][2022-09], conditional on editor review.

# 2023-05
The [plenary discusses double construction of the `this` value][2023-05] ([pull request #41][]) and resolves to merge the pull request that fixes it.
